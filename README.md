# GDEC
Transfer learning for clustering single-cell RNA-seq data crossing-species and batch, case on Uterine fibroids
## Code description
The files starting with util is the processing code for each dataset.   
The files starting with DECtransfer are the training codes for each dataset.  
dglNet.py is the util for construct the GCN.  
dglNet_batch_gene.py is used for constructing embedding features of genes.  
DECpredictValid.py is used for predict the result.
